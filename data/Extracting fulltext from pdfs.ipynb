      "Abstract\n",
      "Background: The key enzymes of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in C4 plants have evolved\n",
      "independently several times from C3 isoforms that were present in the C3 ancestral species. The\n",
      "C4 isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), the primary CO2-fixing enzyme of the C4\n",
      "cycle, is specifically expressed at high levels in mesophyll cells of the leaves of C4 species. We are\n",
      "interested in understanding the molecular changes that are responsible for the evolution of this C4-\n",
      "characteristic PEPC expression pattern, and we are using the genus Flaveria (Asteraceae) as a model\n",
      "system. It is known that cis-regulatory sequences for mesophyll-specific expression of the ppcA1\n",
      "gene of F. trinervia (C4) are located within a distal promoter region (DR).\n",
      "Results: In this study we focus on the proximal region (PR) of the ppcA1 promoter of F. trinervia\n",
      "and  present  an  analysis  of  its  function  in  establishing  a  C4-specific  expression  pattern.  We\n",
      "demonstrate that the PR harbours cis-regulatory determinants which account for high levels of\n",
      "PEPC expression in the leaf. Our results further suggest that an intron in the 5' untranslated leader\n",
      "region of the PR is not essential for the control of ppcA1 gene expression.\n",
      "Conclusion:  The  allocation  of  cis-regulatory  elements  for  enhanced  expression  levels  to  the\n",
      "proximal  region  of  the  ppcA1  promoter  provides  further  insight  into  the  regulation  of  PEPC\n",
