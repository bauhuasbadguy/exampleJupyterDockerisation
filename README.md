# Example Jupyter Dockerisation


### Introduction

In this notebook I am making an example of Docker being used to run a Jupyter notebook. This version comes with a number of python libraries which can be found in requirements.txt. This was created for the openvirus project (https://github.com/petermr/openVirus) so I may be adding example notebooks for processing data for that project.

### Instructions

In order to use this repo clone it as normal and run `run_notebook.sh`. Wait a few minutes for the tool to start and copy the 127.0.0.1 address in full into your browser to start using the notebook.
This was tested on Ubuntu so further work may be needed to make the tool easy to use by windows users.
